  </div>
  <p>The death penalty, also known as capital punishment, is a legal sanction that involves the execution of an individual convicted of a specific crime, usually a capital crime or offense. This punishment has been used throughout history and across various cultures and legal systems. Its primary aim is to deter criminal behavior and retribution for the most severe crimes, such as murder, espionage, treason, and terrorism.
Methods of execution have varied over time and place, including techniques such as hanging, firing squad, lethal injection, electrocution, and beheading. The death penalty has been a subject of significant debate and controversy, with proponents arguing for its deterrent effect and justice. At the same time, opponents raise concerns about wrongful convictions, racial and socioeconomic biases, and the morality of taking human life as punishment.
In recent decades, the global trend has been moving towards abolishing the death penalty, with over 100 countries repealing it in law or practice. However, some countries like the United States, China, Iran, and Saudi Arabia continue to practice capital punishment. The topic remains divisive and a significant focus in criminal justice and human rights discussions.</p>

  <p>The death penalty is a legal process in which a person is sentenced to death by the state as a punishment for a crime they have committed. The method of execution varies by country. The use of the death penalty is controversial, with arguments for and against its use. As of 2021, 54 countries still have the death penalty, while 143 countries have abolished it in law or practice. In the United States, the death penalty is legal in 27 states, but its use has declined in recent years. The use of the death penalty remains controversial and heavily debated worldwide.<a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org"> Deathpenalty Information Center</a></p>

    <h2> Execution Graph</h2>
    <p>Since the reinstatement of the death penalty in the US in 1976, there have been 1,533 executions, with Texas, Virginia, and Oklahoma having the highest number of executions. However, the use of the death penalty has been declining in recent years, with fewer executions and new death sentences. The federal government resumed executions in 2020 after 17 years and carried out ten executions, but there have been none since September 2021.</p>
